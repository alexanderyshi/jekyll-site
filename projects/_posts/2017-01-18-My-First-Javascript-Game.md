In an effort to spend more time with Tina during my 4 months away in Vancouver, and as an exercise on the knowledge I'm gaining from my internship at EA on the games industry, I decided to learn how to make web games with my girlfriend.

The platform will be javascript, as it will easy to learn, then teach Tina. Code will be portable between Windows and OSX, as we will simply test in Google Chrome. I wanted to implement gameplay ideas without any overhead in thinking about... everything else that needs to be implemented for a game. So our first game we've decided will be a clone of the Neopets Ice Cream Machine game that we played as children.
