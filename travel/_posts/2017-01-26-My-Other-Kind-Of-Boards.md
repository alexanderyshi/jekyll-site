*If I was not to become one with the mountain as a ski bum, I think I'd still be working with boards of a different type.*

It was almost 5 years ago that it started seemingly innocuously, as all deep rooted habits do. A friend back in Scarborough first introduced it to the rest of us. Before long, the video games that we all grew up playing started getting replaced with visiting his cute little Pig shaped house off Sheppard and Kennedy to get another kick. My name is Alexander, and I am addicted to euro style board games.

Maddy tells me it was supposedly her idea to have a board game room get together with the other coops. I'm not sure how well I remember that, but I knew that I was going to have to find a board game room in Vancouver within the term. On top of that, we were still not too familiar with the other coops at EA, so it wasn't too long before I made the message to our private Slack channel. The other coop on UFC, Zachary, pointed out the glorious combination of wood oven pizza and a decent collection of board games all under one roof just off of Stadium-Chinatown station. 

At final call we were down for 8 at Ludica - a perfect sized group to split into two games. I got to teach a few games and learn a few along the way. The pizza was wonderful too after I traded away a few slices of the artichoke pizza I ordered. I'm not sure what I was thinking, either.
