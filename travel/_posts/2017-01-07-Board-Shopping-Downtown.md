When I came to Vancouver I told myself I would return with two things: 1) a dope-ass knowledge base on the games industry 2) the ability to never sweat on double-black backcountry pow runs. While I'm sure the first will come to me over time, the latter I will need to get started on ASAP. And that means board shopping.
