It's one of those mornings again. 

I can tell that it's a peculiar sort of morning for me because I've lost my otherwise voracious appetite for food and the usual chug and churn of my mind has halted into what feels like silent numbness. It may seem that I also want to use the washroom, but I know that my body is playing tricks on me. This usually only happens to me the morning of a big event. In the past it's been anything from Lego Robotics competitions to high school dances. The nerves tend to work themselves out, as I am often just anxious about getting there on time if not excited for the day ahead of me. Today I have a new type of challenge though. I've never gone through something like this completely alone before.

I am T-minus 45 minutes from leaving Tina behind, who stayed the night so that we could be together for the new year. There are 90 minutes until I get dropped off by my parents at the airport, and 180 minutes until I leave behind the comfort and familiarity of the South Ontario area I've lived in for my whole life. Today I am flying to Vancouver to live with a stranger, whom I have never met, in the ground unit of a duplex in Burnaby. The last time I stepped foot in British Colombia was nearly seven years ago, where my family stopped in Golden at the end of a road trip through the Rockies. In other words, I have never really been to BC and I have no idea what to expect from the Vancouver area.

Well, actually I do have some clues as to why I chose to fling myself across the country for four months. My soon-to-be roommate is named Maddy, a Hamilton native taking computer science at UWaterloo. In two days I will have my first day as an EA Burnaby intern, where I will work as a developer for the UFC franchise team. I took this job to try working on a team at a much higher level than the embedded systems programming roles I took on my last two internships. From my high school physics teacher I adopted the attitude of being a life-long learner, and so I am excited to learn more about game development and the industry surrounding it. For the last year I have been curious about trying to visit Seattle and potentially work there - Vancouver has been compared to Seattle frequently. Lastly, it is about time that I committed to getting better at snowboarding.

There were definitely apprehensive moments after accepting the offer from EA. I'd be leaving behind my girlfriend, which is not a good way to start our recently started relationship. I'd be leaving behind my parents, whom I already feel guilty about for not having visited frequently enough in the last year. I'd be leaving behind all of my friends in the GTA and from Waterloo, as I am one of very few Vancouver bound interns that I know of.

Despite all of these challenges, I am optimistic to take on this challenge. Two years ago I committed to something in a similar manner by taking a job at Kobo in Liberty Village. I was scared of the idea of leaving Toronto behind then and the thought of leaving for 4 months sounded abhorrent. The ensuing term was one full of frustration, loneliness, and a realization that I was not ready to leave my comforts yet. After plenty of lessons on growing up in the last two years, I feel that I am finally independent enough to try again to be cast out for 4 months again. This time I should be much better equipped with the tools to take care of myself.
