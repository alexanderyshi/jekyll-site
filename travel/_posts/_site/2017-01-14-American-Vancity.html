<p>Before I’ve even tried finding sushi in Vancouver or climbing a mountain in the Rockies on my trip, I’ve already gone ahead and scampered off to another city. An American city. Seattle. People say it’s a close comparison to Vancouver just 3 hours off across the border. I was pretty curious to find out for myself.</p>

<p>I like the idea of having a huge spending power working for a tech giant in a city that still doesn’t cost an arm and a leg to live in.</p>
